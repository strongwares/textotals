sizing notes:
- responsive css vars in aatapp.css:
  default:
  --responsive-width: 400px;
  --responsive-overlaywidth: 400px;
  --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: calc(50% - 200px);
  --sidebarHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  --sidebarContentHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  or?
  --sidebarHeight: 80vh;

  screen sizes under 640:
    --responsive-width: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlaywidth: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: 4px;

screen heights:
default:
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 17rem);
height under 655
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 18rem);


SideBar in App.js style:
height: 'var(--sidebarHeight)',
maxWidth: 'var(--responsive-overlaywidth)',
marginTop: '1rem',
marginLeft: 'var(--responsive-overlayMarginLeft)',

SideBar holds Overlay:
width: 100%
height: 100%

Overlay renders a HelpOverlay:
- useEffect hook grabs parent div height and sets
  height to height - 100px,
  where height is the p-carousel-content and
  p-sidebar-content height overrides to
  --sidebarContentHeight

- displays a Carousel with a prop:
  verticalViewPortHeight={`${height}px`}


Each HelpOverlay Carousel  item is defined as a
"helpscreen-item" class in help/screens/helpscreen.css
- max-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)
- min-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)

Put info page somewhere like zanshin.dev

Don't open source aat.fyi, but make it its own landing page:
  - with the gatsby page like zanshin
  - with ability to run aat.fyi in a popup dialog



ipfs
- investigate for user mgmt
- investigate for user's data persistence

social media logins

help screen additions:
- note possibility for deficit spending
- note the two month history behavior
- note that not connected to any actual bank or other service:
  The Textotals brain is not very well connected.
  It does not (yet?) actually connect to any actual external services.



add history action:
- container
- action op
- parse
- parse test
- action handler
- acction handler test
- update help
- help screen


add a clear action:
- action op
- parse
- parse test
- action handler
- acction handler test
- update help
- help screen


monetize via incentive of a premium mode:
- ipfs persistence
- enables actions:
  link, history, export, clear
- storage beyond two months
- export action or menu option from history

need customer support:
- create textotals@sw.com
- put email addr in a final help screen

add trimmed down aat.fyi repo:
- new repo
- keep only set and spend actions
- deploy to DigiOcean
- subdomain on textotals.com
- add info page like zanshin.dev

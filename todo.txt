sizing notes:
- responsive css vars in aatapp.css:
  default:
  --responsive-width: 400px;
  --responsive-overlaywidth: 400px;
  --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: calc(50% - 200px);
  --sidebarHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  --sidebarContentHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  or?
  --sidebarHeight: 80vh;

  screen sizes under 640:
    --responsive-width: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlaywidth: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: 4px;

screen heights:
default:
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 17rem);
height under 655
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 18rem);


SideBar in App.js style:
height: 'var(--sidebarHeight)',
maxWidth: 'var(--responsive-overlaywidth)',
marginTop: '1rem',
marginLeft: 'var(--responsive-overlayMarginLeft)',

SideBar holds Overlay:
width: 100%
height: 100%

Overlay renders a HelpOverlay:
- useEffect hook grabs parent div height and sets
  height to height - 100px,
  where height is the p-carousel-content and
  p-sidebar-content height overrides to
  --sidebarContentHeight

- displays a Carousel with a prop:
  verticalViewPortHeight={`${height}px`}


Each HelpOverlay Carousel  item is defined as a
"helpscreen-item" class in help/screens/helpscreen.css
- max-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)
- min-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)

prune aatapp src/lib to have just few public example actions
prune help to remove premium screen
prune all mention of textotals from aatapp 

- add Premium screen items:
  - All action, account, totals data stored, not just one month's worth.
  - Your data stored on the IPFS, where you can access it yourself, not siloed and hidden in this app.
  - Access to a "link" action, that allows two user's accounts to be linked, like a joint checking account
  - Print data screens.
  - Export of data.

  - ipfs persistence
  - enables actions:
    link, history, export, clear
  - storage beyond two months
  - export action or menu option from history
  



dana
ipfs storage
- investigate for user mgmt
- investigate for user's data persistence

d 2) Not Really Texting

Its not really a text, it only goes to the Textotals
app's little brain.

The Textotals app figures out your account totals
and texts them back to you here
\/


Well not really a text, but after the Textotals app's
brain calculates your account and category totals, it
prints prints the time and action you took and resulting
account totals here
\/


d 3) Actions

What actions does the Textotals app know about?

Here are the actions you can type in:
add
spend
move
set
adjust
give


) The "set" Operation

First you want to "set" your main account starting total:

Example:
   set 500 


) Account Names

The Textotals brain keeps track of an account named "MAIN"
for you automatically.

So the 

  set 500

action is the same as if you had entered

  set 500 MAIN

or
  set 500 main


) Many Account Names

Textotals can remember lots of account names.

All you have to do is enter the names after the number.

Example:

  set 500 another account

  set 500  accountX

  set 500  account


)  Account Group Names

The Textotals brain keeps track of what group your accounts are in automatically.

Textotals likes to call that automatic account group name "PERSONAL".

So this text:

  set 500 

Is the same as if you had entered:

  PERSONAL set 500 MAIN


) Many Account Groups

Textotals can keep track lots of accounts in different group names.

All you have to do is enter the account group name before the name of the operation.

Example:

  work set 500

  school set 500

  contract x set 500 account a

  contract x set 500 account b

  contract y set 500 account a


) Uppercase Letters

Textotals likes to keep track of your account and spending category name using

  ALL UPPERCASE LETTERS.

That just makes it easier for its little brain to keep
track of things.



) The "add" Operation

Text "add" to tell Textotals to add an amount to one of
your accounts.

Example:

  add 500

  add 500 savings

  add 500 alice savings

  contract x add 500 account a


10) The "spend" Operation

Text "spend" to tell Textotals that you've spent some of
the amount from one of your accounts.

Example:

  spend 50.99

  spend 10.99 from savings

  contract x spend 190.04 from account a

11) Spending Categories: STUFF

To help keep track of budgeting, you can tell Textotals what category that you've spent time or money on.

Textotals keeps track of a spending category named "STUFF" for you automatically.

It will use the category named "STUFF" if you don't enter a category name.

Example:

  spend 50.99

  spend 10.99 from savings

  contract x spend 190.04 from account a


) Spending Categories

You can tell Textotals exactly what category you are spending on.

Example:

  spend 50.99 on gas

  spend 50.99 on books

  spend 50.99 on restaurant

  spend 50.99 on groceries

You can tell Textotals what account you spend from

Example:

  spend 100 on books from savings

  spend 400.99 on travel from rainy day fund

  contract x spend 485.01 on software from account a

) The "move" Operation

Text "move" to tell Textotals that you want to move some of
the amount from one account to another account.

Example:

  move 100 from main to savings

  contract x move 299 from account a to account b


) The "adjust" Operation

Text "adjust" to tell Textotals that you need to adjust the total
amount that is in of your accounts.

The "adjust" operation adds or subtracts an amount from one of your accounts.

Example:

  adjust 50.99 savings

  adjust -0.99

) The "give" Operation

Text "give" to tell Textotals that you've spent some of
the amount from one of your accounts on charitable giving.

The Textotals brain likes to keep track of the charities that you give to separately from the other categories that you spend money on.

Textotals keeps track of a giving category named "CHARITY" for you automatically.

It will use the giving category named "CHARITY" if you don't the name of who you gave to.

Example:

  give 200

  give 500 to HOMELESS

  give 500 to Charity X from savings


)  Possibilities

The Textotals brain thinks of actions and account totals
as just plain numbers.

So you can use Textotals to create account groups
and accounts to track both time and money.

Or keep track of anything that you can think of that 


    SCHOOL set 50 alice

    SCHOOL set 50 bob

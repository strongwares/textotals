sizing notes:
- responsive css vars in aatapp.css:
  default:
  --responsive-width: 400px;
  --responsive-overlaywidth: 400px;
  --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: calc(50% - 200px);
  --sidebarHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  --sidebarContentHeight: calc(100% - 1rem);
  or?
  --sidebarHeight: 80vh;

  screen sizes under 640:
    --responsive-width: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlaywidth: calc(100% - 10px);
    --responsive-overlayMarginLeft: 4px;

screen heights:
default:
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 17rem);
height under 655
--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight: calc(100vh - 18rem);


SideBar in App.js style:
height: 'var(--sidebarHeight)',
maxWidth: 'var(--responsive-overlaywidth)',
marginTop: '1rem',
marginLeft: 'var(--responsive-overlayMarginLeft)',

SideBar holds Overlay:
width: 100%
height: 100%

Overlay renders a HelpOverlay:
- useEffect hook grabs parent div height and sets
  height to height - 100px,
  where height is the p-carousel-content and
  p-sidebar-content height overrides to
  --sidebarContentHeight

- displays a Carousel with a prop:
  verticalViewPortHeight={`${height}px`}


Each HelpOverlay Carousel  item is defined as a
"helpscreen-item" class in help/screens/helpscreen.css
- max-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)
- min-height: var(--responsive-helpScreenItemHeight)

- parse test
- action handler
- acction handler test

d need customer support:
d - create textotals@sw.com
d - put email addr in a first help screen


d- clearer onboarding help:
d  - animated arrow to help when no users
d  - update first help screen with set and spend examples
d- note the one month history behavior
d- note that not connected to any actual bank or other service:
d    The Textotals brain is not very well connected.
d    It does not (yet?) actually connect to any actual external services.
d- add to ww points example to possibilities

--
d add Premium screen items:
d  - All action, account, totals data stored, not just one month's worth.
d  - Your data stored on the IPFS, where you can access it yourself, not siloed and hidden in this app.
d  - Access to a "link" action, that allows two user's accounts to be linked, like a joint checking account
x  - The ability to export your data.

--

d- mirror to textotals repo
d- mirror to aatapp repo

d- deploy textotals to render.com:
  d - create static deploy

d- don't show the accounts if empty
d- don't show the totals if empty

d- swipe to scroll content within a too-tall help screen causes switch to next help screen

  d https://render.com/docs/custom-domains#configuring-dns-to-point-to-render
  d https://render.com/docs/configure-namecheap-dns

d- setup ssl cert on render.com:
  d- https://render.com/docs/ssl: says that it should work out of the box
  d- just took little time for the letsencrypt certbot to kick in

  d- copy latest to aatapp:
    d - possibilities help screen
    d- account and totals not showing empty accounts
    d - HelpOverlay

d- do timeline in totals tab:
d  - how much was spent in each category per day
d  - use the primereact timeline component
d  - how to integrate:
d    - new icon on header with text: Timeline: pi-clock icon
d    - on click popup a new vertical timeline overlay
